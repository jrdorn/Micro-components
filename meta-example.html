        <p>I'm creating a link to <a href='https://mozilla.org/en-US/' target='_blank' title='The best place to find out about Mozilla'>the Mozilla homepage</a></p>

        <p><a href='https://reddit.com' target='_blank' title='Internet cesspool'>Reddit</a> is great and terrible at the same time. It's really interesting to see
        what other people are thinking about and what their perspectives are, and to find communities of others interested in the same things that you are. Some content
    can be questionable, but overall it's a good site.</p>


        <p><a href='https://neopets.com' target='_blank' title='Nostalgia'>Neopets</a> was one of the first websites I went on as a child. I loved played games with 
        my friends on there, and felt physical pain when I didn't log in for a long period of time and came back to find my tuskaninny starving. Neopets also taught
    me a bit of HTML and CSS by having me create my own pages for my Neopets, which was fun.</p>

        <p>TheWineKone was one of <a href='https:youtube.com' target='_blank' title='A place to watch videos'>Youtube's</a> earliest vloggers. It's strange to think that it's been 15 years since 2005, and how much the world has changed.
            Numa Numa, Tay Zonday, What What (In the Butt). The internet was so young and innocent. Thinking about it makes me feel more motivated and connected to 
            what technology could be.

        <p>Here be a blockquote...</p>

        <p>And here is a normal quote!</p>
            <p>The quote element - <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> is <q cite='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q'>intented for short
