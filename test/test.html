            The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
            iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he
            who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak
            through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper
            and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee
            with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to
            poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the
            Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

            Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It
            all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
            arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And
            most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way
            back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called
            me Mr Glass.

            Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
            bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I
            do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the
            exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get
            some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
            connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
            ends.
          </p>

            You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
            a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
            murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
            don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
            seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
            took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
            snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
            it doesn't hold a candle to man.
