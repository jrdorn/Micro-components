            <h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

            <p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago...</p>

            <p>Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter
            may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat
            had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
            this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
            predator â€” Tommy the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
            occasion such as this that he did.</p>
